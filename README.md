# Discord-Bot-For-STEAM-Club
This is a little project for a club that I'm in for STEAM. I hope this is good enough.
If you have an idea (or issue) for a bot command, then put it in issues :)

## Commands

> help: Brings up the help menu

> schedule: Gets default (and only default) date for the meeting every Thursday

> getsource: Gets the link for this GitHub (pls no copy and paste)

> hi: Says hi to you (also gives you a free ping)!

> wisdom: Gives you the wisdom dog link (friend inspired)

> rickroll: Gives you the Rick Roll link (friend inspired)

> slap: I don't even know why I added this... it's part of the bot now, we don't question the commands around these parts.

> rps: Rock Paper Scissors... warning: extremely cAsE sEnSiTiVe
 
> gay: Friend wanted me to add this so here it is: it's just a random number generator (0-100)

> creator: Wait... why are you here if you don't know who created this bot? Anyway, I'm Kimi and I created this bot :)





### These commands are also EXTREMELY CASE SENSITIVE so don't come to me and say that these commands aren't working when you are typing in all caps :)
